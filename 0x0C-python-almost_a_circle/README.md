## NOTE #1: ARGS AND KWARGS

### Definitions:
 - *args and **kwargs are special keyword arguments that allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a Python function.

| Keyword  | Descriptions                                                                    |
| -------  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *args    | Accepts a variable number of non-keyword arguments and stores them in a tuple.  |
| **kwargs | accepts a variable number of keyword arguments and stores them in a dictionary. |

### Usage:
 - To use *args and **kwargs, you simply need to add them as parameters to your function definition. For example:

```python
    def my_function(*args, **kwargs):
    # Do something with args and kwargs 
```
 - To pass arguments to your function using *args and **kwargs, you simply need to pass them as positional arguments or keyword arguments, respectively. For example:

 ```python
    my_function(1, 2, 3, name="Joseph")
 ```
### Advantages of using args and kwargs:
 - Using ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` has a number of advantages, including:
    - It makes your functions more flexible and reusable. You can use ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` to write functions that can accept any number of arguments, regardless of their type.
    - It makes your code more readable and maintainable. When you use ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``, you can clearly see what types of arguments your function accepts and how they are used.
### Best practices for Using args and kwargs:
 - Here are a few best practices for using ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``:
    - Always put ``*args`` before ``**kwargs`` in your function definition.
    - Use keyword arguments to pass named arguments to your function.
    - Use ``*args`` to pass a variable number of positional arguments to your function.
    - Use ``**kwargs`` to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to your function.
    ### Example:
     Example 1: Using *args to pass a variable number of positional arguments
    ```python

        def print_args(*args):
          for arg in args:
            print(arg)

        print_args(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    ```

     Output:
    ```bash
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
    ```
     
     Example 2: Using **kwargs to pass a variable number of keyword arguments
    ```python
        def print_kwargs(**kwargs):
            for key, value in kwargs.items():
                print(f"{key}: {value}")

        print_kwargs(name="Alice", age=25, occupation="Software Engineer")
    ```

     Output:
    ```bash
        name: Alice
        age: 25
        occupation: Software Engineer
    ```

     Example 3: Using *args and **kwargs together
    ```python
        def my_function(*args, **kwargs):
         # Do something with args and kwargs

        my_function(1, 2, 3, name="Alice", age=25) 
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are powerful tools that can make your Python code more flexible, reusable, 
> readable, and maintainable. Be sure to learn how to use them effectively.

## NOTE #2: JSON ENCODER AND DECODER

 ### Definitions:
 JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format that has become the most popular medium of exchanging data over the web. 
 
 The reason behind its popularity is that it is both human-readable and easy for machines to parse and generate.

 Python provides a built-in json library to deal with JSON objects. This library includes two important classes:
  - ``JSONEncoder``: This class encodes Python objects to JSON strings.
  - ``JSONDecoder``: This class decodes JSON strings to Python objects.

 ### Usage: JSON Encoder
 To encode a Python object to a JSON string, you can use the ``json.dumps()`` function. This function takes a Python object as input and returns a JSON string as output.
 
 For example, the following code encodes a Python dictionary to a JSON string:

 ```python
    import json

    my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

    json_string = json.dumps(my_dict)

    print(json_string)
 ```

 Output:
 ```JSON
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
 ```

 ### Usage: JSON Decoder
    To decode a JSON string to a Python object, you can use the ``json.loads()`` function. This function takes a JSON string as input and returns a Python object as output.
    
    For example, the following code decodes a JSON string to a Python dictionary:

```python
    import json

    json_string = """{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}"""

    my_dict = json.loads(json_string)

    print(my_dict)
```

 Output:
```JSON
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```

 ### Encoding and Decoding custom objects:
 The ``json.dumps()`` and ``json.loads()`` functions can be used to encode and decode most Python objects. However, if you have a custom object that you need to encode or decode, you can subclass the ``JSONEncoder`` and ``JSONDecoder`` classes.

 For example, the following code shows a subclass of the ``JSONEncoder`` class that can encode a custom object called ``Point``:

```python
    import json

    class Point:
      def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

      def __repr__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

    class PointEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
      def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, Point):
          return {"x": obj.x, "y": obj.y}
        else:
          return super().default(obj)

    my_point = Point(10, 20)

    json_string = json.dumps(my_point, cls=PointEncoder)

    print(json_string)
```

 Output
```JSON
    {"x": 10, "y": 20}
```
 Similarly, you can subclass the ``JSONDecoder`` class to decode custom objects.

 ### Remarks:
 The ``json.dumps()`` and ``json.loads()`` functions are powerful tools that can be used to encode and decode Python objects to and from JSON strings. If you need to encode or decode custom objects, you can subclass the ``JSONEncoder`` and ``JSONDecoder`` classes.

## NOTE #3: Unittest module
 The unittest module is a built-in Python module that provides a framework for writing and running unit tests. Unit tests are small, self-contained tests that verify the functionality of a single unit of code, such as a function or class.

 To use the unittest module, you first need to import it into your code:

```python
    import unittest
```
 Next, you need to create a subclass of the ``unittest.TestCase`` class. This class provides a number of methods that you can use to write your tests, such as ``assertEqual()``, ``assertTrue()``, and ``assertFalse()``.

 For example, the following code shows a simple unit test for a function called ``add()`` that adds two numbers together:

```python
    import unittest

    class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):

      def test_add_two_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)

      def test_add_two_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, -2), -3)
```
 To run your tests, you can use the unittest.main() function. This function will automatically discover all of the test cases in your code and run them.

 For example, the following code runs the unit tests for the TestAddFunction class:
 
```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
     unittest.main() 
```
 If all of your tests pass, you will see the following output:
 
 Output:
```bash
    Ran 2 tests in 0.002s

    OK
```
 If any of your tests fail, you will see an error message that indicates which test failed and why.

 ### Advantages of using the unittest module

 There are a number of advantages to using the unittest module to write your unit tests, including:

 - The unittest module is built-in to Python, so you don't need to install any additional libraries.
 - The unittest module provides a simple and easy-to-use framework for writing and running unit tests.
 - The unittest module is flexible enough to handle a wide variety of testing needs.

 ### Best practices for using the unittest module

 Here are a few best practices for using the unittest module:

 - Write a unit test for every unit of code in your program.
 - Make sure that your unit tests are independent of each other. This means that each unit test should be able to run without relying on any other unit tests.
 - Use descriptive names for your unit tests. This will make it easier to understand what each test is doing.
 - Use the unittest.skip() decorator to skip unit tests that are not yet implemented or that are not currently relevant.
 - Use the unittest.expectedFailure decorator to mark unit tests that are expected to fail. This can be useful for testing negative scenarios.

 ## Remarks:

 - The unittest module is a powerful tool that can help you to write and run unit tests for your Python code. By following the best practices outlined above, you can ensure that your unit tests are effective and efficient.
