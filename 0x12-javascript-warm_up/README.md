# JAVASCRIPT WARM UP

## Introduction

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a website. It was originally invented by Brendan Eich.

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, and very flexible, thus unlocking a vast amount of functionality with a minimum effort. This includes:

- Browsers Application Programming Interfaces(APIs)
- Third Party Framework and libraries.
